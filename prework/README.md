**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 

Submitted by: **ELLIOT ERHUNMWUOSERE**

Time spent: **8** hours spent in total

Link to project: (insert your link here, should start with https://glitch.com...)

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [Y] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [Y] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [Y] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [Y] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [Y] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [Y] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [Y] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[WWW.W3SCHOOLS.COM]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[The part that was a bit more chanllenging was Handling guesses. even though i was at least able to visualize most steps required to complete the game logic, I wasn’t exactly sure how to put them in codes. Therefore, I just typed out every line one at a time. Doing this helped me understand the functionality of almost all lines of the logical part. then i suceeded in Breaking them down in my own way to enable me read them fluently. But it took me quite a while to read them. And this, I believe is due to the fact that I’m not exactly proficient in javascript. but with the little that i understood, i was able to provide comments to explain whats going on in those lines.
The other not so interesting challenge I faced was misspelling the “getE”ementByID" which literally took about an hour to spot. Not exactly up to the recommended words, but that’s all I have.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[The impact of Artificial Intelligence in Web 3.0 and How much it will will be needed in the in the implementation of various functionalites in the future.]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[the feature i would be most interested in adding which i noticed from the beginning was the fact that the computer literally follows a specific pattern as the game goes. it would be nice to be able to randomize the computer's play style at the start of every game. which will definately make it more interesting and dificult as a game. ]
